SERVER DOCUMENTATION
================

Configuration
----------------
Server configuration is currently not necessary.  

Running
----------------
After compiling the server, a "Marti-immortals.jar" executable will be generated.  As long as this is in the same directory as "CoreConfig.xml", you should be able to run it with the following command:  

    java -jar Marti-immortals.jar

Monitoring
----------------
Currently, all data being received by the server is printed to stdout (Including image Base64 dumps), so it can be monitored via the terminal.
