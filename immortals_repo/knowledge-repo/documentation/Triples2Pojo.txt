==Issues List==

- Some vocabulary is no longer defined for properties/concepts currently in the ontology. All reported offenders are:
-- hasDependentVariable
-- hasIndependentVariable
-- (has)FunctionalityAbstraction
-- ByteArray
-- hasConfigurationAspect
-- configurationVariable
-- CotMessage
-- DfuDataFlow
-- hasConstraintCriterion **

** I think the referenced field is supposed to be hasTriggeringConstraintCriterion

-An instance that can be multiple types currently breaks Triples2Pojo, as it doesn't know which to pick. A possible fix is examining types
 for which one the instance more (closely?) resembles.
 
-Similarly, a concept with a predicate that has two objects can break the program.
