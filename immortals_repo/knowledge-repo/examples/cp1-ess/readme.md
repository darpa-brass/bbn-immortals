### Purpose of this document
This document provides an overview of an Exemplar Software System (ESS) developed for the purpose of IMMoRTALS Phase III CP1 evaluation.

### Purpose of the ESS
The ESS demonstrates problems that arise when assumptions made by application developers about concerns that transcend the application boundary (in this case, schema compliance) are baked-in to application code and subsequently broken by ecosystem changes (in this case, schema evolution).

### ESS project structure 

  * Non-code artifacts
    * *schema*
      * *schema/v1* contains a schema used in a WSDL with dependencies on MDL_v0_8_17.xsd.  This was derived from SwRI's MDL_v0_8_17_with_Examples.zip.
      * *schema/v2* contains a schema used in a WSDL with dependencies on MDL_v0_8_19.xsd.  This was derived from SwRI's MDL_v0_8_19_with_Examples.zip.
	  * *schema/v3* currently a copy of schema/v2
    * *messages* 
      * *messages/v1* contains several representative XML messages conformant with MDL_v0_8_17.xsd.  These were copied from SwRI's MDL_v0_8_17_with_Examples.zip. <span color="red">**NOTE** that one of the original XML documents, VariableLengthPackages.xml, has validation issues and has been disabled for the time being.</span>
	  * *messages/v2* contains several representative XML messages conformant with MDL_v0_8_19.xsd.  These were copied from SWRI's MDL_v0_8_19_with_Examples.zip.
	  * *messages/v3* currently a copy of messages/v3
  * Code artifacts
    * *schema-code* 
      * *schema-code/v1* contains [autogenerated Java types](http://www.mojohaus.org/jaxb2-maven-plugin/Documentation/v2.2/) derived from schema/v1
	  * *schema-code/v2* contains autogenerated Java types derived from schema/v2
	  * *schema-code/v3* contains autogenerated Java types derived from schema/v3
	* *servers* 
	  * *servers/v1* is a Java [spring-boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) app that runs an [embedded](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-embedded-web-servers.html) [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) instance that listens for [SOAP/XML](http://webreference.com/authoring/web_service/index-2.html) messages containing v1-compliant documents
	  * *servers/v2* expects to receive v2-compliant documents
	  * *servers/v3* expects to receive v3-compliant documents
    * *clients* 
	  * *clients/v1* is a Java spring-boot client that converses with a server using v1-conformant documents
	  * *clients/v2* uses v2-compliant documents
	  * *clients/v3* uses v3-compliant documents

### Architecture and evolutionary pressure

The dataflows along which adaptation may need to occur are called out in numbered edges below:
```
                                  SOAP/XML
                                  messages
                      /--------\             /--------\ 
                      |        | ====(2a)==> |        |  
[documents] ---(1)--> | CLIENT |             | SERVER |
                      |        | <==(2b)==== |        |
                      \--------/             \--------/
```

  1) This dataflow involves the client reading MDL documents from the local file system of the platform on which it executes.  See client:com.securboration.client.ClientRunner (line 101).  If the schema version of the documents differs from the client, adaptation will be required along dataflow 1.  
  2) This dataflow involves (2a) the client transmitting an MDL document to the server and (2b) receiving a response.  See client:com.securboration.client.MessageListenerClient (line 44).  If the schema version of the client differs from that of the server, adaptation will be required along 2a and 2b.
  
### Evolutionary pressure
Evolutionary pressure arises when 
  1) Documents read by the client from the file system are non-compliant with the version for which the client was explicitly coded.
  2) Documents transmitted to the server from the client are non-compliant with the version expected by the server.
  3) Documents received from the server by the client are non-compliant with the version expected by the client.
  
To make things more explicit, the following degrees of freedom are defined for the CP:
  1) CLIENT_SCHEMA_VERSION (one of v1, v2, v3)
  2) SERVER_SCHEMA_VERSION (one of v1, v2, v3)
  3) CLIENT_INPUT_MESSAGE_SCHEMA_VERSION (one of v1, v2, v3)
  4) CLIENT_INPUT_MESSAGES (this is a non-enumerable parameter representative of the subset of the schema that adaptation must address)

There are 27 unique {CLIENT_SCHEMA_VERSION, SERVER_SCHEMA_VERSION, CLIENT_INPUT_MESSAGE_SCHEMA_VERSION} tuples.  Exactly three of these (those in which the client, server, and client input message versions are equal) will not require adaptation under any circumstance.  The remaining 24 configurations will require varying degrees of adaptation, qualified by the complexity of the CLIENT_INPUT_MESSAGES set.  

During adaptation, our system will learn the portion of the XML Schema actually used by the app over all CLIENT_INPUT_MESSAGES (under the assumption that the set of CLIENT_INPUT_MESSAGES provided are representative of all aspects of the schema that must be handled).  More complex XML documents will therefore result in more involved adaptation (a very simple document, for example, would require no adaptation under any of the 27 configurations).


### Building the ESS

#### Prerequisites
  1) Gradle (tested with 4.9) (validate with gradle -version) **OR** Maven (tested with version 3.3.9) (validate with `mvn -version`)
  2) Java (tested with 1.8.0_161).  Validate with `java -version`
  3) Connectivity to the Internet.  This is a build-only requirement--executing the ESS does not require Internet access.
  4) The ESS codebase in a directory subsequently referred to as `$ESS_HOME`

#### Procedure
All commands are executed from `$ESS_HOME`

To build the software using Gradle, execute the following command:
```
	gradle clean build
```

To build the software using Maven, execute the following command:
```
	mvn clean install
```

**NOTE** that your first build may be quite time consuming as dependencies are downloaded and cached (subsequent builds should be much faster).

### Running the ESS
All commands are executed from `$ESS_HOME`

#### Prerequisites
  1) Java 8 (tested with 1.8.0_161).  Java 9 and Java 10 are not currently supported.  Validate with `java -version`
  2) You must have previously built the ESS

#### Running the server
To run the v1 server:
```
	java -jar ./servers/v1/target/immortals-cp3.1-server-v1-1.0.0.jar
```

To run the v2 server:
```
	java -jar ./servers/v2/target/immortals-cp3.1-server-v2-1.0.0.jar
```

To run the v3 server:
```
	java -jar ./servers/v3/target/immortals-cp3.1-server-v3-1.0.0.jar
```

NOTE: By default the server starts on port 8080.  If another port is desired, it can be specified like so:
```
	java -Dserver.port=8081 -jar ./servers/v3/target/immortals-cp3.1-server-v3-1.0.0.jar
```

#### Running the client

To run the v1 client (with v1 inputs):
```
	java -DMESSAGES_TO_SEND_DIR=./messages/v1 -DREPORT_DIR=./report -DSERVER_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8080/ws -jar ./clients/v1/target/immortals-cp3.1-client-1.0.0.jar
```

To run the v2 client (with v2 inputs):
```
	java -DMESSAGES_TO_SEND_DIR=./messages/v2 -DREPORT_DIR=./report -DSERVER_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8080/ws -jar ./clients/v2/target/immortals-cp3.1-client-1.0.0.jar
```

To run the v3 client (with v3 inputs):
```
	java -DMESSAGES_TO_SEND_DIR=./messages/v3 -DREPORT_DIR=./report -DSERVER_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8080/ws -jar ./clients/v3/target/immortals-cp3.1-client-1.0.0.jar
```

The MESSAGES_TO_SEND_DIR property specifies a directory containing XML documents compliant to V1, V2, or V3 as specified for the client during the build (the use of a directory containing a V1 document with a V2 client would be considered an incorrect use of the software and *not* evolutionary pressure).  The client traverses this directory and recursively visits any XML documents found.  Each document is modified by the client and transmitted to the server (note that for builds with a different client and server version, this will cause the code to break).  Each document is treated as a separate test case and the number of passing test cases are emitted to ./report (specified by -DREPORT_DIR) after processing all documents.

The SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL property specifies the endpoint of the server.  You may need to modify the host and/or port.
