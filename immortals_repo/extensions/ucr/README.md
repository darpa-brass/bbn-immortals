Instruction:
0. To simply try the tool, you can comment out the ./sync_bin.sh line in resourceAnalysis.sh and skip the step 1 and 2
1. Setup the project in Eclipse or other IDEs
2. Change sync_bin.sh to set the correct class files path and copy them over to bin directory
3. Put the apk that you want to analyze in directory ./apks (BluetoothSimulatedGpsRunner.apk already there)
4. Download sdk and soot directories from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_9E0g1jz8WSnk7dylvs21fB1zks2ZiTs?usp=sharing
5. Put the two directories under the root directory of this project
4. Use resourceAnalysis.sh to run the analysis (Pleaes check the comments in the script)
