Required Inputs for Constraint Assessment
1) Dataflows
	- Atak -> Marti
		-- There are primarily four dataflows from Atak to Marti that are required
		   in order to perform constraint assessment:
			--- The dataflow carrying Atak's output stream abstraction (java/nio/channels/SocketChannel) from Dispatcher.java
				to WriteHandler.java
			--- The dataflow carrying the Atak's CotMessage to WriteHandler.java
			--- The dataflow carrying Marti's input stream abstraction (java/net/Socket) from TcpSocketServer$1.java to 
				TcpTransport.java
			--- The dataflow carrying the received CotMessage from Atak
	- Marti -> Atak
		-- These flows are similar to above, only reversed
	- All dataflows can be found in /Dataflows
2) Constraints
	- Data Safety Constraint
		-- All data between an Atak Client and Marti Server (and vice versa) must be encrypted
	- Packaged with dataflows
3) Usage Paradigms
	- Tells constraint assessment how to use specific libraries
		-- How to initialize cipher implementations
		-- How to configure cipher implementations
		-- How to retrieve underlying input/output streams
