Note 1: To learn over a different schema, stop the database, go to step 3, and use the new schema in step 4.

Note 2: To learn other target relations, go to their corresponding directories in step 4 and follow same procedure.

Note 3: Target relation advisedBy (in folder target-advisedby) is set to run for 5 folds, which replicates the results in "Schema Independent Relational Learning" (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3035923).
