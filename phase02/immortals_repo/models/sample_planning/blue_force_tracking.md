The designation "blue force" indicates those friendly forces;
this is in opposition to "red force" which indicates hostile forces.

A significant problem in military action is "friendly fire".
This is a result of the "fog of battle" where "initial contact with the enemy"
results in the breakdown of plans.
Historically, this problem has been mitigated by partitioning the battle-space.
This partitioning assigns responsibility for and access to
a geographic space to particular units.
This means that if a unit sees a hostile in a zone outside of their
assigned zone they should not fire upon them but leave them to the
unit to which that zone was assigned.
Certainly this results in the loss of missed tactical and strategic opportunities.
In order to support this military model the size of the blue-force must
increase so as to overwhelm the red-force.

The ability to track the blue-force opens the window for dynamic
reassignment of geographic responsibility and allows for the adaptation
among friendlies. Therefore, a mission requiring more flexibility in
blue-force assignments will require regular updates regarding position,
movement and maneuvers. This relationship is an ongoing area of military research.
We can hypothesize that there is some measure of flexibility which is
one input to a function which returns the rate at which situational awareness
information must be available in order to sustain the target flexibility.

This in another resource which must be maintained and is under the
control of the sustainment officer. The sustainment officer will delegate
this responsibility to the officer responsible for network deployment.

The information concerning the red-force obtained from the intelligence
officer is coupled with the blue-force information. There will also be
information goals for the red-force positions. And, the red-force will
be striving to disrupt both information streams.

For this project we will establish a small representative set
of actions and events which will necessitate adaptation in the field.

== Sample Model ==

It is typical that blue-force units are assigned to areas of responsibility.
Each unit may be in its assigned area, some other area or its location
can be ambiguous or unknown.
Each area can be thought of as a set where the units are members of sets.
