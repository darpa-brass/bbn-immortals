### Web GME import files ###

These JSON export files are used for archival or otherwise serializing a GME model.
They are named according to the following pattern:

  e.g. immortals_dm_v03_master.json
      <project>_<type>_v<version-number>_<branch>.json


The "kds" files contain a subset of the information from the export files.

  e.g. immortals_kds_dm_v02_a01.json
       <project>_kds_<type>_v<version>_a<serialization-version>.json

The name for the kds has two version numbers, one version number for the model and one for the serialization.
