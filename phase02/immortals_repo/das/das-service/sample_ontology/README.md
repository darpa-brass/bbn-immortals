## Tasks

### update events

The sample das input are edits to a baseline set of system models.
The goal is to construct a new model with as much structural sharing from the baseline.
Using GME makes it possible to generate the full mega-model each time.
This is problematic for MIT-LL as they will want to only specify the changes to the baseline.

### name reconciliation

Only the classes and properties need to be given names from the ontology.
The instances can have names generated as GUIDs (class name + guid).
